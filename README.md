# Shopify_sales_analysis
## Analysing the customer trends,patterns, sales performance, retention and key value KPIs using POWER BI.

## Charts that I created in this dashboard and their uses are :

1.Card chart to show the  sales performance such as total sales before tax, total quantity sold, average order value by each customer.
   2nd row indicating the total customers, customers with single order and repeated customers (customers who came back and made the purchase)
    3rd row indicating the total purchase amount a customer had made till now, percentage of  customers who came back to make purchase again with us (showing the trust with the company) Purchase frequency.

2. Shape map to show the sales by each region.

3. Bubble map to show where the purchases were made inside the state or province meaning finding the exact location of customer.

4. Clustered bar chart to show the sales made by each city.

5. Area chart to find out the sales trend by days where the most sales have happened on monday and other days meeting the minimum target sale.

6. Stacked column chart to find out the sales trend by hour of the day indicating that customers make alot of purchases on the day time and after 12 am the sales drop down(maybe we can introduce  midnight sales to promote more sales on night)

7. Donut chart to find out the payment methods used by customers(Shopify payment method is dominating by where more than 50% of the purcchases made by the  customers have used shopify payment method this indicates a good sign for the business.

8.  Stacked column chart to find the total sales by each category and shoes category is topping the list where as gift cards, books etc need to imporve and make a new stratergic change to promote sales in those other category.
